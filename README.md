Living room remote control program

## Controlled appliances
1. Sound system that could be turned on/off, raise and lower the volume.
2. TV that could be turned on/off, raise and lower the volume, and switch TV programs.
3. Heating System that could be turned on/off, and set the temperature.
4. Turn the lights on and off in every room.
5. To all appliances add default random parameters (turned on/off, volume from 0 to 100%, etc.) and print it to the console (Default parameters could be added via Constructor/Init block/Setters).
6. Print to console time mark at the time of parameter change.
7. All appliances have restrictions. Restrictions are based on custom-made exceptions: incoming restriction (as example - if to turn on/off appliance you use parameters “on” or “off”, any other parameter throws exception) and state restriction (as example - if maximum level of volume is 100, parameter that set it to 105 throws exception).
